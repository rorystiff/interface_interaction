My aims for this project are to learn HTML,CSS and some JS. This will help me to complete my project and improve upon my skills.

Here are my initial ideas from my research:

- A website to download protest signs
- A text adventure to explore discrimination
- discrimination in crime
- misinformation in news, a newssite from a racist/non-racist view point
- a chatbot from different viewpoints
- an anti social media iPhone case
- A mock plugin that disables racism
