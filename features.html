        <div class ="update1"><h2>Machine Learning</h2>Enra is easy to use, once installed if desired Enra requires no more interaction and will work straight away. By using machine learning, analysing and compling how users use Enra, a global databse has been created that will automatically block any offensive posts. This means that the user can continue using the internet how they would before but only now they will be shielded from any offensive posts.</div>
        
        <div class = "update1"><h2>Block lists</h2>As well as the smart blocking created by Enra, users also have the option to create their own lists of phrases and users that they wish to block online. This list is seperate to the global list and is the private to the user. This means that a user can block words + users that offend them and them alone, or it can be used in conjunction with the global list to cover a much larger scope online.</div>
        
        <div class = "update1"><h2>Image Blocking</h2>Whilst this is still in beta, users now have the option to also hide images that they don't wish to see. By using machine learning again, we have trained Enra against a set of over 2 billion images and she is now able to accurately block images demeaned offensive online. This can also be used in conjunction with the word/user blocking to ensure that users get the maximum coverage online. </div>
