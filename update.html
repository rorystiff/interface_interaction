        <div class ="update1"><h2>Update 1.1.2</h2>In this update we have added the functionality of being able to highlight and select phrases or words that you come across online that you would like to be hidden in the future. This makes for a smarter Enra that will be able to predict what words you will want to be shielded from and automatically hide them before you even come across them. For posts on social media this means that the entire post will be hidden whereas for articles or similar you will have the option to have selected words replaced with more appropriate words.</div>
        
        <div class = "update1"><h2>Update 1.1.1</h2>This update brings many new features that enable you to more safely navigate the web. These new features allow you to create and edit a block list, this will ensure that you never have to view certain posts or tweets by any of these users. By analysing all these lists Enra will start to learn what accounts even doesn't want to view therefore creating a shared community block list that users can choose to use if they don't wish to create their own list. Many other minor bugs have also been squashed.</div>
        
        <div class = "update1"><h2>Update 1.1.0</h2>In this update we have fixed many issues from previous releases as well as adding many new features. For example Enra will now automatically update in the background to ensure you have the most up to date software. Another brand new feature is the option to hide racist images online, whilst still in beta Enra will now trawel through images online using machine learning to detect if she deems any images as offensive. These images will then be hidden from your view, once again imrpoving your online experience. </div>
